Hi <%=h @invitee.name %>,

You've been invited to <%= Site::Config.event.name %>!

<% if @invitee.inviters.length == 1 -%>
You were invited by <%= @invitee.inviters.first.name_with_email %>
<% else -%>
We've sent you an invite before, but this is to let you know that <%= @invitee.inviters.last.name_with_email %> has invited you too.

The full list of people who've invited you is:
<% @invitee.inviters.each do |i| -%>
  <%= i.name_with_email %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>

Thanks, Hetty.
