Hi <%=h @punter.name %>,

Just a final few things we'd really like you to take note of, please read:

First: note our "I'm lost" phone number:

Write it down somewhere. Ring it if, well, you're lost.

Second: Slight change of route

It's been brought to our attention that there are some roadworks outside Lewes,
which makes our original directions a little muddy.

So...

* From just north of Brighton, take the A27 towards Lewes.

* At the roundabout, follow diversion signs to Kingston, where-er they take you.

* Go though Iford, then Rodmel;

* Take a right towards Telscombe and follow for 1000m, you'll see us on the right.

* Remain calm. Do not panic. The number one enemy of progress is questions.

Hetty.

PS:

* Print out and bring your tickets, although we'll cope if you can't

* Bring some 'ecover' washing-up liquid to help make the waterslide super-wooshy!
