Hi <%=h @punter.name %>,

Ooh the people Iâ€™ve met
Are the wonders of my world...

Awww, frak me, eh?

Well, did anyone somehow manage to scrape together having a good time?

An awful lot of people worked very hard to make that happen, and a lot of them didn't even pay the concession rate...

An awful lot of very talented people played their instruments or spun their discs because they wanted to.

An awful lot of people cut things out, stuck things with glue and screwed things together.

An awful lot of people picked up litter and sorted through recycling bins.

An awful lot of people chipped in 40 quid.

There are an awful lot of good people.

We're going to have to move next year - sadly, that was our last year at Telscombe.
So...anyone got a farm? We're a nice bunch...

My name is Hetty Widegirth, I deal in human fulfillment...time of your life, huh, kid?

Love, til next time,

Hetty
(for we are Legion)
