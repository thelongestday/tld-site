Hi <%=h @order.owner.name %>,

At last - we've issued the tickets for <%= Site::Config.event.name %>.

The ticket contains directions and other important info, please have a look.

<% if @order.is_just_for_owner? %>
We've attached your ticket to this mail. You can also pick it up from the website.
<% else %>
We'll send each of the people you bought tickets for their own individual ticket also.

The order was for <%=h @order.tickets.map { |t| t.punter.name }.join(", ") %>
<% end %>

Awesome, see you there!

Thanks, Hetty.
