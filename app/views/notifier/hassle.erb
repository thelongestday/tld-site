Hi,

Firstly, sorry if you've been receiving lots of TLD mail. We're very keen to make sure
everyone gets the info about ticket sales. Forgive us if you've had enough already!

You've accepted your TLD invite, but by an unfortunate oversight you don't seem to have a ticket!

Surely this is a mistake! Read on for foolproof reasons why you should buy tickets now:

We only have the money you give us, we stop selling tickets on the 15th July to give us time to hire all the lovely things...
As usual there will be NO ON THE DOOR SALES!!

Ladies and Gentlmen look what we have for you...

emphasis is on infectious grooves and strong production.
