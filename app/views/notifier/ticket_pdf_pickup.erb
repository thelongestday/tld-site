Hi <%=h @ticket.punter.name %>,

At last - we've issued the tickets for <%= Site::Config.event.name %>.

We've attached your ticket to this mail. You can also pick it up from the website.

The ticket contains directions and other important info, please have a look.

<% if @ticket.order.owner == @ticket.punter  %>
This copy of your ticket just lists you, rather than including the people you also bought tickets for.
<% else %>
We've also sent <%=h @ticket.order.owner.name %> a copy of your ticket, since they were kind enough to buy it for you! :)
<% end %>

Awesome, see you there!

Thanks, Hetty.
