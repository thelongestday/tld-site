Lucky you! <%=h @order.owner.name %> bought you a ticket for <%= Site::Config.event.name %>.
<% end %>

For reference, the details of your ticket are:

Ticket: <%= @ticket.id %>
Order:  <%= @order.id %> (<%= @order.uid %>)

We'll be issuing the tickets closer to the event from the website, and will send

Thanks, Hetty.
